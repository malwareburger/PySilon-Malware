***Hello Everyone! Here is the beginners step-by-step guide to using PySilon Discord bot malware***

***PySilon Malware:** This software was not created by me nor do I claim to have created it. All credit goes to it's owner: mategol (https://github.com/mategol)*

***Discord Bot Basic Conf:** This config was not created by me nor do I claim to have created it. All credit goes to it's owner: idently (https://github.com/indently)*

**Discord Bot Setup:**
1. Go to -> discord.com -> settings -> advanced -> make sure developer mode is selected on

2. Go to -> discord.com/developers/applications/ -> new application -> give name and create

3.  After bot is created: Click on the Bot tab and make sure all options under " Privileged Gateway Intents " is selected on.

4.  Now click on the reset token button (might add screenshots of everything later if I remember), place your 2FA codes in (if applicable), and use copy button to copy the token and place it into a default .txt (we will need this later and don't want to forget that)

5.  Add the bot to your discord server of choice (if you are using this for "authorized pentesting purposes" make sure you use a discord with little to no members in it if you don't want to leak information) using this link -> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot (you can find client id under the OAuth2 tab at the top).

6.  Now you will need to create your discord bot with a simple python script(basic config is in the repository). For windows I suggest using Visual Studio Code (download here -> https://code.visualstudio.com/) and for linux you could probably just use sudo nano or sublime text but if you would like to test+debug find yourself a program that does testing and debugging.

7.  Before you start your python script for your bot(or if you are following basic config) make sure you run:
pip install discord
pip install python-dotenv

If you don't already have them installed

8. Now create your discord-bot.py script or if you are following basic config all you need to do is place your bot token (the one you placed in the .txt file) and insert it into the .env file where it says "YOUR_KEY" and CTRL+S to save it.

9. Now if you are using VSC or any other debugger run the script to verify it works
If you are using the basic config it should display:
INFO     discord.client logging in using static token
INFO     discord.gateway Shard ID None has connected to Gateway (Session ID: *YOUR_SESSION_ID*).
*YOUR_BOT_ID* is now running!

10.  If all is working you are now able to move onto the malware
