# PySilon-Malware
***Hello Everyone! Here is the beginners step-by-step guide to using PySilon Discord bot malware***

**Credits:** 

***PySilon Malware:** This software was not created by me nor do I claim to have created it. All credit goes to it's creator: **mategol*** (https://github.com/mategol , https://github.com/mategol/PySilon-malware/tree/main)*

***Discord Bot Basic Conf:** This config was not created by me nor do I claim to have created it. All credit goes to it's creator: ***idently*** (https://github.com/indently , https://github.com/federicoazzu/discord_tutorial_2024)*

**Discord Bot Setup:**
1. Go to -> discord.com -> settings -> advanced -> make sure developer mode is selected on

2. Go to -> discord.com/developers/applications/ -> new application -> give name and create

3.  After bot is created: Click on the Bot tab and make sure all options under " Privileged Gateway Intents " is selected on.

4.  Now click on the reset token button (might add screenshots of everything later if I remember), place your 2FA codes in (if applicable), and use copy button to copy the token and place it into a default .txt (we will need this later and don't want to forget that)

5.  Add the bot to your discord server of choice (if you are using this for "authorized pentesting purposes" make sure you use a discord with little to no members in it if you don't want to leak information) using this link -> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot (you can find client id under the OAuth2 tab at the top).

6.  Now you will need to create your discord bot with a simple python script(basic config is in the repository). For windows I suggest using Visual Studio Code (download here -> https://code.visualstudio.com/) and for linux you could probably just use sudo nano or sublime text but if you would like to test+debug find yourself a program that does testing and debugging.

7.  Before you start your python script for your bot(or if you are following basic config) make sure you run:
- pip install discord
- pip install python-dotenv

- If you don't already have them installed

8. Now create your discord-bot.py script or if you are following basic config all you need to do is place your bot token (the one you placed in the .txt file) and insert it into the .env file where it says "YOUR_KEY" and CTRL+S to save it.

9. Now if you are using VSC or any other debugger run the script to verify it works
- If you are using the basic config it should display:
- INFO     discord.client logging in using static token
- INFO     discord.gateway Shard ID None has connected to Gateway (Session ID: *YOUR_SESSION_ID*).
- *YOUR_BOT_ID* is now running!

10.  If all is working you are now able to move onto the malware

**PySilon Malware Setup:**

***If any errors happen during this process or requests to add features go to: https://github.com/mategol/PySilon-malware/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE***

1. Download and unzip/extract the "PySilon-malware-main.zip" file listed in the repository 
- *Alternatively you could just run: git clone https://github.com/mategol/pysilon-malware from the terminal to install*

2. Change your directory ( *cd pysilon-malware on linux, cd 'C:\Users\**YOURUSER**\wherever you extracted probably Downloads or Desktop\PySilon-malware-main' for Windows PWRShell * )
or go to where you extracted the file and double click the .bat file if you're using windows 

3. Run the file
   - Windows: ./PySilon.bat
   - Linux: ./PySilon-linux.sh
   - or just double click the file like stated above

   - If it's your first time running the file it might download some stuff just let it download and accept any changes if applicable

   - When completed or on startup after the first run it should say:
   - Initializing the virtual environment...

   - Then after 10-15 seconds the builder.py GUI should pop up
   - This is where you would input:
   - **Server Id:** this is where you put the id of the server you added the bot into ***recommend you use a server with only your account and the bot to not leak anyones information***
   - **Bot Token:** Same token you saved to .txt file and put in the .env file
   - **Registry Name:** default is PySilon (change to whatever if you are cloaking the file for "pentest" reasons)
   - **Folder Name:** same as above
   - **Executable Name:** default is PySilon.exe
   - **Custom Icon:** click on the png and it will open a file select you can input any image file for the desired icon. Default is the pysilon malware disc.png
   - You can also enable/disable features on the right hand side as you please
   
   - If this isn't your first time running the .bat or .sh file and you would like to recompile your last configuration click the "**Load Configuration**" button at the topp of the screen
   
1. After you are done changing the file to your liking scroll down to the bottom and checkmark the disclaimer.
2. Then click "**Generate Source**"
3. Lastly click "**Compile**"

- The compiler should start running. If it states that there is a file in a temp folder that it couldn't delete this is fine the compiler is still functioning and you can delete the folder after the compiler is done, just let it run until it sends you into the "**dist**" folder when completed. 

- The file in the "**dist**" will say: source_prepared.exe and it will have the default icon, to change this just rename the file to: "example.exe" (input the exe name you used in the builder) and it will change the file name and icon to the one you chose.

4. Your compiled malware is now ready to be used.
   - Send the file to a desktop virtual machine like VirtualBox or VMWare to test the malware or send to "pentest" target of choice

   - Make sure the "**main.py**" file you configured for the discord bot is running and the user is appearing online in your discord server

5. Once malware is downloaded and running on the target device the bot will auto create 5 channels named:
   - # info
   - # main
   - # spam
   - # recordings
   - # file-related
   &
   - A Voice Chat named: Live Microphone

   - Open the README.md file in PySilon folder to see all commands you can run with the discord bot

   - You will know the malware has worked when it displays IP, Device, and Passowrd information in the # info channel
   &
   - if in the # main channel it states:
   - "*Starting new PC session at **DATE MALWARE WAS RUN** on HWID:**TARGET PC'S HWID** && Bypassed UAC!
   - [**DATE MALWARE WAS RUN**] Started recording...*"

   - If this is true congratulations you've now run the PySilon Malware using Discord Bot application!


**Conclusion:**
- Following this guide, you should now have successfully set up and run the PySilon malware using a Discord bot. 
- This walkthrough is intended for educational purposes and authorized pentesting only. 
- All credit for the PySilon malware goes to its creator, ***mategol*** (https://github.com/mategol/PySilon-malware/tree/main), and the Discord bot configuration goes to ***idently*** (https://github.com/federicoazzu/discord_tutorial_2024).
